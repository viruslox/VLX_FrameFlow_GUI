// We cannot easily test Run or HandleWebSocket directly without network overhead
// because they tightly couple to gorilla/websocket network connections,
// and the WSHub explicitly iterates over `*websocket.Conn` keys, writing to the actual network.
//
// However, we can test that calling Broadcast places the message correctly onto the channel.
// The rationale states: "Creating channels and broadcasting mock data can be done easily within a single test without network overhead."
